This scripts simulates the effect of an adiabatic shock on the density of a one-dimensional gas.

The simulation uses a donor cell advection scheme with reflective boundary conditions. The 
simulation is driven by pressure differences after an initial gaussian perturbation is 
applied in the center of the media.

The density distribution is shown in the top panel whereas the mach number per cell is drawn
below.
